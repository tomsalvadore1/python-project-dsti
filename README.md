# python-project-dsti

to create this project, we used jupiterlab v 3.6.3 on an anaconda installation (anaconda is not mandatory but we are using version 23.7.4) the project is using python version 3.11.5

we complemented our python installation with scikit learn 1.3, numpy 1.24.3, pandas 2.0.3, matplotlib 3.7.2, seaborn 0.12.2, math is depending on the python installation.

The goal of the project is to use prediction methods to determine the amount of sleep an animal is getting, and the amount of time spend dreaming. To do this we use some characteristics of the animal, like it's diet for example (the full list of characteristics can be found in the dataset file, those are the columns)
